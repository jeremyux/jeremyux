        </div>
        <div class="intro-value">
          <p class="full-width">I worked with a design agency based out of Japan that works with Japanese clients who have needs for websites of apps. This particular project is called Online Clinic which aims to supply the japanese market with Androgenetic Alopecia medicine. According to the clients, Japanese men tend to have too much shame to enter a brick and mortar clinic so this solution is meant to help penetrate this untapped market.</p>      
        </div>
          
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <p class="full-width section-title"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br></p>
      <p class="full-width">  
        The client had come to our agency which is an already established clinic equipped with men’s health doctors as well as assistants who can help with scheduling. The ask here is to have an online experience that can help process new patients by booking a time and having the patients fill out an intake form for the clinic’s record. 
        <br>
        <br>       
        We had a couple of sessions with the patients to pinpoint that to collect all the necessary data to fulfill an order the client would have to:

        <ol class="counter">
          <li>Signup from the already established landing page</li>
          <li>Have the patient choose a time for the consultation</li>
          <li>Answer patient questionnaire questions</li>
          <li>Consultation with an assigned doctor</li>         
        </ol>    
      </p>

    <div class="clear"></div>
    <ul class="sub-section">
      <li><strong>Process</strong></li>     
    </ul>
    <img src="img/onlineclinic/process.svg" width="100%">
      
    <p class="full-width">Before I started even putting a single pixel to the canvas I wanted to do my do diligence and arm myself with information about the user and the product in the Discover Phase. To start with I first started with some <strong>Background Research</strong> which entailed sitting down with the clients who can to us with the problem in the first place. From there we defined the problem but also the business need we are trying to fulfill. From there it was clear that they wanted to define themselves differently from their other online men’s clinics like Hims from the United States but at the same time wanted to leverage some of their thinking in how they keep users from dropping off the sign-up process. I did my own <strong>Heuristic Analysis</strong> with comparable companies like Hims and Keeps which sells male pattern baldness medication on their websites. All of this thinking was also centered around the <strong>User Personas</strong> we developed which is based on what we thought an average Japanese male patient would interact with our app.</p>   
    <p class="full-width">Now that I’ve better familiarized myself with the problem and built some empathy with the user I wanted to start thinking about defining how the user might go about buying medication from Online Clinic. We started with a kickoff meeting with the client to see how they operate offline and proposed this project as an extension to the business they already have in place. Together with the client and my product team we mapped up a <strong>Journey Map</strong> showing how a user will follow this path to signup for the service then ultimately buy their medication. </p>   
    <img src="img/onlineclinic/userjourney.svg" width="100%">
    <p class="full-width">Once I got buy-in from both my product team and the client on a simple <strong>User Flow</strong> I then translated the requirements into simple <strong>Wireframes</strong> to make sure I am not forgetting things like errors states and other potential edge cases we’ve missed. From there I put everything into a <Lo-Fi Prototype> to once again finalize the flow without any of the branding colors and aesthetics involved at this point.</p>   
    <p class="full-width">The final step was working with the client's branding team to use the correct <strong>Hi-Fi Mockups</strong> to send specs to engineers as well as a <strong>Hi-Fi Prototype</strong> to show the correct interactions for production</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      <p class="full-width section-title"><strong>EXECUTION</strong><br></p>  
      <p class="full-width"> My goal here is to take these requirements and create a minimal flow to help users subscribe to this men's medicine perscription model. One aspect of this subscription onboarding flow is the likelihood that the user might drop off the flow due to reasons like too many clicks or confusing interactions. By making the the UX is tight we can insure the user finishes the onboarding process which will lead to sales. 
      <div class="clear"></div>
        <ul class="sub-section">
        <li><strong>Choosing a Date & Time</strong></li>     
      </ul>
      <p class="full-width">We wanted to keep this very simple for the user and keep thing interaction at 2 clicks for a happy path. After the user chooses a date the time page will appear prompting the user to choose a 15 min time slot before they can proceed. From the appointment time page the user can still change the date if they did not do so correctly on the previous page.</p>

      <div class="clear"></div>
      <ul class="sub-section">
      <li><strong>Contact Information</strong></li>     
    </ul>
    <p class="full-width">From here we want the user to add their contact information including the method of communication the doctor would use to reach out to them. Once they enter this information we would then have the user acknowledge that all the information is correct before they wait for an email for their incoming doctor's consultation appointment.</p>

    <div class="clear"></div>
    <ul class="sub-section">
      <li><strong>Questionnaire</strong></li>     
    </ul>
    <p class="full-width">From here we want the user to add their contact information including the method of communication the doctor would use to reach out to them. Once they enter this information we would then have the user acknowledge that all the information is correct before they wait for an email for their incoming doctor's consultation appointment. Once again the challenge here is the minimize the the amount of friction the user would have to face which would include extra numbers of clicks necessary to finish this questionnaire.
      <br><br>
      Once the user has successfully filled out the questionnaire we inform them that they would be recieving an email with a link so they can purchase the medication package that was reffered by the doctor.

  <ul class="sub-section">
    <li><strong>Choosing a Medication</strong></li>     
  </ul>
  <p class="full-width">
    Finally once the user gets their email invitation to choose a medication they will click on the link to take them back to an experience where they can choose an approved medication subsciption that the doctor has issued. In this example the user can choose a male pattern baldness medication for

    <p class="full-width section-title"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br></p>
    <p class="full-width">  
In conclusion, the team built this experience to help the client have on online sales funnel for prospective clients. Today the experience can be viewed using Japanese VPN. This has just gone live but has already driven sales to their clinic. I still do support this project to help streamline the experience hoping to increase sales and reduce dropoff now that we have baseline metrics.
